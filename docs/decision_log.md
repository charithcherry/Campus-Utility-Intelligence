# Decision Log

## 2026-06-06: Use DuckDB for the local warehouse

DuckDB is the initial warehouse choice because it supports local analytical SQL workflows without requiring external infrastructure.

## 2026-06-06: Keep raw and generated data out of git

Raw Kaggle data, generated DuckDB files, and report outputs are ignored so the repository remains lightweight and does not commit large or local-only artifacts.
